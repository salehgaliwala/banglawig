        <p><strong><u>Hair duplication:</u></strong></p>
        
        When you order a hair duplication service at Wigbangladesh.com by filling the online order form, you are required to make sure the information you fill, choose or remarked are as faithful as possible to the target system you are going to send to us. Your order price will be calculated automatically by our website system based on those information you provided. In the occasion that we find there has been a discrepancy or in-corrections in the details between your online order form you submitted and your actual target hair system which you send to us, we reserve the right to deny your order and don’t put it to production even if it has already been accepted by our website system automatically. If the payment we received can not cover the duplication cost, your order will not be proceeded until the balance payment is made to us. This course takes time and your order delivery time should be counted from the date everything is clear and balance payment made. We will not be responsible for this delay, you are responsible for it. If you find that the order price has increased and you will not go ahead with this order or want to drop this order, we need to charge you $30 as a handling charge. In the same situation, if you want us to send back the target system to you, you should pay the shipping charge, the charge should be subject to actual cost. This charge will not be refunded.

        Removes glue and other residue from base.

        -Hair refill
        
        Loose hairs are removed and replaced with new hair that is color and density matched.
        
        <p><strong><u>Note</u></strong></p>
        
        We CANNOT replace all the hair on the system. We replace loose hair with new hair. However, over time old hair will continue to loosen and shed.
        
        While repair prolongs hair system lifespan, it is a short term solution. The only long term solution is to buy a new hair system.

        No refunds are offered for repair under any condition.

        <p><strong><u>Rush Delivery terms:</u></strong></p>
        
        In general terms Rush production services allow the client to receive his or her hairpiece quicker than they would normally under standard conditions. We give a general guideline of 4-6 weeks for standard orders. Some complicated orders and full cap wigs may take even longer time. In no way do we guarantee an exact date or timetable for this service. All hairpieces are made custom and such no exact time can be guaranteed. This service means it will be faster production than if a person chooses standard. NO REFUNDS will be made for "rush" fees for delays. However, at the discretion of Wigbangladesh.com we may credit the "rush" fee if the production is unusually past the "rush" time schedule.
